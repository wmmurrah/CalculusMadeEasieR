The notes are based multiple sources including a classic book by Thompson &amp; Gardner (1998), and a great textbook focusing on calculus and probability in the life sciences(Adler, 2012).

So it makes sense that \\(g(x)\\) starts at 0 on the y-axis. It also make sense that \\((f * g)\\) starts at zero on the y-axis, because any value of \\(f(x)\\) will be multiplied by zero, which will result in zero. It is also intuitive that both \\(f(x)\\) and \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) start at 4 on the y axis, because \\(f(x)\\) is 4 when \\(x\\) is zero (\\(f(x) = 0\\)), and adding zero to this does not change this value (\\(f(x) + g(x) = (4 + 0) = 4\\), when \\(x=0\\)). 2.0.2 1.2.4 Finding Inverse Functions "],["methods.html", "Chapter 3 Methods", " Chapter 3 Methods We describe our methods in this chapter.
