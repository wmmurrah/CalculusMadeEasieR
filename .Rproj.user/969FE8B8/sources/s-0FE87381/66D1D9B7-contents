description: "This is a collection of notes used to learn calculus and Nonlinear Modeling Using R"
---

# Preface {-}

This is a collection of notes I generated while using R to learn calculus for statistics in general and  nonlinear modeling specifically.
The notes are based multiple sources including a classic book by @thompson1998calculus, and a great textbook focusing on calculus and probability in the life sciences[@adler2012modeling].
