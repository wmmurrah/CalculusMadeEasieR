### Exponentials and Logarithms

An exponential is represented as $e^x$ or exp($x$), with $e$ being the constant  `r round(exp(1),3)`....
Some things to know about exponentials, and how to generate them in are include [@bolker2008ecological]:

 $\text{exp}(1) = e = 2.718282$, 
 
```{r}
exp(1)
```
 
 $\text{exp}(0) = 1$, 
 
```{r}
exp(0)
```
 
 $\text{exp}(-\infty) = 0$, 
 
```{r}
exp(-Inf)
```
 
 and $\text{exp}(\infty) = \infty$,
```{r}
exp(Inf)
```
 
Logarithms can have
